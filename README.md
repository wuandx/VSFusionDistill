# ao-det — degradation-robust sonar–camera fusion detection (F2)

English | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

An underwater robot sails with a forward-looking sonar and a camera. The sonar is indifferent to turbidity; the camera degrades continuously with turbidity and light, from clear water (D0) through heavy degradation (D4) to effectively gone (D∞). This codebase trains and evaluates two-stream sonar–camera detectors across that whole reliability axis, asking two questions: does training-time privileged distillation (a teacher that sees the clear camera, a student that sees the degraded one) beat inference-time feature fusion at protecting the sonar branch; and what does this "mutual enhancement" cost, given that downstream consumers treat the two branches' detections as independent evidence — how much does it correlate their errors?

Full research plan: `doc/topic-f2-degradation-robust-fusion-detection-distillation-2026-10.md` · current mainline and roadmap (2026-11-01 review + 2026-11-02 second review, read §0 mainline, §8 execution discipline and §9 second review first): `doc/f2-rethink-2026-11-01.md` · experiment ledger (per experiment: setup / results / interpretation / conclusion): `doc/experiments.md` · narrative build logs: `doc/logs/` (Chinese).

Base stack: MMDetection 3.3.0 (YOLOX family) + mmengine 0.10.7 + torch 2.1.2, pinned in `env/` (a torch 2.7.1+cu128 `.venv-gpu` exists for the local RTX 5090; see `env/ENVIRONMENT.md`). No third-party repo is modified: `third_party/` is cloned read-only with pinned SHAs (`tools/clone_third_party.sh`, `third_party/PINNED.md`).

## 1. The problem this code addresses

Deployment reality: an ROV/AUV has both a forward-looking sonar and a camera online, and camera reliability is a continuum, not a switch. Existing methods cover only the two ends of that spectrum: sonar-only distillation (CMOLD/CMHD; the D∞-endpoint expert, wastes the camera when it is clear) and inference-time fusion trained under nominal conditions (RSFusionDet et al.; never systematically tested under degradation). In clear water, feature fusion buys a single branch only ~1 AP; the headroom is in the degraded regime. And no acoustic–optic detection work in the literature has reported branch error correlation, yet downstream consumers (target mapping / association) use per-modality detections as conditionally independent evidence, so AP bought by mutual enhancement can turn into downstream overconfidence. Full argument: topic doc §1.

This repo runs controlled comparisons — same framework (MMDetection/YOLOX), same data, same degradation protocol:

| research question | in one line | where it lives in the code |
|---|---|---|
| RQ-0 (gate) | Does inference-time cross-attention fusion drag the sonar branch down as the camera degrades (mutual poisoning)? | per-branch D0–D∞ scan of `s0_cross_attn` vs `s0_b0` (`tools/test.py`) |
| RQ-1 | For the sonar branch, is training-time distillation or inference-time fusion more effective? | method space B1 vs B2/B3 vs M3 (§2.3) |
| RQ-2 | Of the distillation gain, how much is capacity gain (big teacher → small student) vs privileged gain (teacher sees clear, student sees degraded)? | 2×2 attribution: same/large teacher × degraded/clear teacher input |
| RQ-3 | Is cross-plane bearing-window distillation better than per-grid distillation? | `aodet/models/losses/cross_plane_mil.py` |
| RQ-4 | How much does mutual enhancement correlate the two branches' errors, and what does that cost? | `aodet/evaluation/branch_correlation.py` |

## 2. Approach

### 2.1 The student: two streams, three heads

Every method shares one student skeleton, `TwoStreamYOLOX` (YOLOX-S scale; teacher and student stay in the same family so per-prediction distillation lines up):

```
camera image ──► cam backbone ──► cam neck ──┬────────────────► camera head          (L_det^c)
                                              │                  degraded D0–D∞ at train time
sonar  image ──► son backbone ──► son neck ──┼──► fusion ──────► fused sonar head    (L_det^s)
  (never degraded)                           │
                                              └────────────────► uncoupled sonar head (L_det^s0)
                                                                 · pre-fusion sonar features only,
                                                                   never sees the camera
                                                                 · D∞ fallback + decoupled
                                                                   bookkeeping, reported separately
```

- The camera head reads camera features; the fused sonar head reads fused features (default: cross-attention, sonar queries camera); each is supervised by its own modality's GT.
- The uncoupled sonar head is the design key (topic doc, tension 1): it yields a sonar output uncontaminated by camera coupling, falls back naturally at D∞, and is accounted separately at evaluation time.
- Dropping the camera stream (`camera_backbone=None` + `NoneFusion`) yields the B0 sonar-only baseline, the strongest single-modality reference inside the same framework.

### 2.2 Privileged distillation

The teacher always sees the clear camera frames (geometric augmentation applied synchronously to teacher and student), so its outputs can be cached offline; currently it runs online under `no_grad` (`FrozenTeacher`), and the cache must pass an equivalence test first.

```
clear camera frame ──► FrozenTeacher (bigger / same-capacity two-stream YOLOX, no_grad)
        │
        ├─ head objectness + class distribution ──► branch_kd ──► student camera/sonar heads
        │                                   (objectness & class only, no box regression)
        │
        └─ camera detections ──► M₀ nominal geometry (camera angle → sonar bearing window)
                            └─► cross_plane_mil: inside the window, the student sonar
                                 head's MAX objectness along range must match the teacher
                                 · positive evidence only: camera missed ≠ nothing in the strip
                                 · windows widened by the M₀ calibration residual
```

Training distribution: each sample's camera input draws s ~ p(s) from {D0,…,D4,D∞} (`AOSampleDegLevel`). At train time D∞ is materialised as a black frame (batches stay dense, `dinf_mode="zero"`); at test time the camera is truly dropped (batch 1, `dinf_mode="drop"`). The sonar is never degraded: the sonar-configuration axis belongs to the sibling topic F1.

### 2.3 Method space and where this repo stands

| family | topic-doc id | recipe | status (2026-11-01) |
|---|---|---|---|
| sonar-only baseline | B0 | single-stream single-head YOLOX-S | `configs/f2/e09_s0_b0_jitter_yoloxs.py` (E09b); test sonar sits on the floor on the sample platform (class-aware ≤ 0.04) |
| inference-time fusion | ≈B2/B3 | two streams, three heads + cross-attention, p(s) degradation sampling in training | `configs/f2/e10_b3_degaug_yoloxs.py` (B3), `s0_b2_cross_attn_nominal_yoloxs.py` (B2); E09c/E10 sonar heads on the floor, RQ-0 not measurable |
| privileged distillation | B1, M1–M5 | frozen clear-view teacher + branch_kd + (M4) cross-plane MIL | E10 M3 (τ=2) gives only a directional camera-branch reading, verdict downgraded; cross-modal class route (teacher camera → student sonar via π) to be implemented, tested in E12 |
| late fusion reference | B5 | two single-modality detectors matched at result level | planned (structurally uncoupled; correlation reference) |

The full method space (B0–B6, M1–M5) is defined in topic doc §2.2; per-experiment progress lives in `doc/experiments.md`.

Mainline status (2026-11-01 review, see `doc/f2-rethink-2026-11-01.md`, Chinese): E01–E10 fixed a chain of foundation problems that would have distorted any fusion/distillation verdict (table below), but the sample platform cannot measure F2's core question. Each of the 5 recordings holds exactly one class and each class has a single training recording, so class and recording are fully confounded; sonar readings have stayed on the floor; seed noise (about ±0.02) is the same size as E10's decision threshold. E10's positive camera reading comes from a class-ranking shift on one recording (100927), with privilege, capacity and class prior not separated, and E10's sonar route (sonar←sonar) cannot carry privileged information when fusion barely uses the camera. Adjustment: research questions unchanged; the measurement platform moves to a class-balanced recording-level split of the full UXO dataset (E11), which first measures the ceiling, the platform band and σ; then cross-modal class distillation with a class-prior control tests H-cls (E12), with the sonar branch back as the primary endpoint.

| foundation finding | consequence for fusion/distillation if left unfixed |
|---|---|
| GT double-scale poisoning: geometric projection boxes span half the image while echoes are compact (E04) | the sonar head never learns boxes; every KD loss is computed on wrong supervision |
| evaluation aliasing bug: the two sonar heads share samples and the later fused pass overwrites the earlier uncoupled one (E07 erratum 2) | the fusion-vs-no-fusion comparison compared one output against itself; "fusion has no effect" was a measurement artifact; fixed + anti-alias regression test |
| KD loss keys without a "loss" prefix are logged but never backpropagated by mmengine (code review §1.1) | M-series distillation losses would train nothing while looking healthy; fixed, distillation starts from the new code |
| scale jitter exactly undone by the fixed-size resize (E08 erratum) | scale-augmentation robustness conclusions are guaranteed false negatives; E09b confirms the scale axis fixed with the repaired jitter |
| old training recipe: no pretrain, 8× lr, no EMA (E07 erratum 3) | B2-vs-B0 and M1-vs-B2 gains are unattributable; E09 switches to the sound recipe |
| recording-level domain collapse + class–recording confound: both modalities collapse on unseen recordings (E07); each class has one training recording in the sample (E08) | every method's sonar reading lands on the floor and effects along s are unmeasurable; remedy is a class-balanced split of the full UXO dataset (E11) |


## 3. Architecture and data flow

Every source dataset is first converted into one paired format; dataset, training and evaluation code are then shared verbatim:

Stage notes:

1. Conversion: one converter per source (UXO is converted end-to-end: 2573 pairs + projection report; the RSFusion/UMOD converters await data). Sonar boxes have no manual annotation; `uxo_projection` calibrates per recording against the official poses and projects. Training GT uses gated visible-echo boxes only (`sonar_gt_sources=("blob",)`; the E06 validity gate showed projected-source frames carry no echo by construction), while projected boxes (clamped to echo scale) serve cross-modal correspondence and the `gt=all` eval view.
2. Paired format: four JSON/CSV files + image dirs are the entire state; `frame_meta.csv` keys each sample to both COCO image ids, the split and the degradation seed.
3. Training: pipeline order is fixed (sync geometry → degradation sampling → fork & pack), no Mosaic/MixUp (teacher/student augmentation must stay synchronous); multi-seed runs via `tools/run_seeds.sh`.
4. Evaluation: `tools/test.py` overrides the dataset's `deg_level` field per level, then infers and stores per-branch predictions and AP; the correlation tool consumes only these stored files, so every method shares the same evaluation path.
5. Records: every experiment enters `doc/experiments.md` in five parts (setup / results / interpretation / conclusion); day-level debugging narratives live in `doc/logs/`.

## 4. Layout

| path | contents |
|---|---|
| `aodet/datasets/` | paired-format I/O (`paired_format.py`), `PairedSonarCameraDataset`, converters (`uxo_to_paired`, `uxo_projection`, `rsfusion_to_paired`, `umod_to_paired`), transforms (paired geometry, camera degradation D0–D∞, fork & pack) |
| `aodet/models/` | `TwoStreamYOLOX` (three heads, `detectors/`), fusion modules (`fusion/`: cross-attn / concat / none), KD losses (`losses/`: `branch_kd`, `cross_plane_mil`), frozen teacher (`teachers/`), `PairedDataPreprocessor` |
| `aodet/evaluation/` | per-branch COCO AP (`per_branch_metric.py`), branch error correlation (`branch_correlation.py`: φ, ΔP_miss, Spearman, naive-Bayes fusion, ECE) |

| `configs/` | `_base_` (model/dataset/schedule/runtime) + `f2/` S0-lite configs (B0, cross-attn) |
| `tools/` | `train.py`, `test.py` (per-branch D0–D∞ scan, per-split / per-recording / per-class output), `project_uxo_sonar.py` (calibration + projection, fingerprint-keyed cache), `uxo_inventory.py` / `split_uxo_recordings.py` (E11 recording inventory & frozen split), `anatomy.py` / `camera_anatomy.py` (per-recording, per-class dissection), `download_uxo_full.sh` (full-UXO download + md5), `check_gt_validity.py`, `make_degraded_testsets.py`, `run_seeds.sh`, `run_loocv.sh`, `collect_results.py`, `correlation_table.py`, third-party pinning, RSFusionDet watch |

| `data/paired/` | converted paired data (UXO: 2573 pairs + projection report & contact sheet) |

## 5. Quick start

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/ -q          # 282 tests collected (2026-11-04)

# S0-lite (UXO sample already converted to data/paired/uxo/)
python tools/train.py configs/f2/s0_b0_sonar_only_yoloxs.py --seed 0
# mmengine writes epoch_N.pth + last_checkpoint (no latest.pth symlink)
ckpt=$(cat work_dirs/s0_b0_sonar_only_yoloxs_seed0/last_checkpoint)
python tools/test.py  configs/f2/s0_b0_sonar_only_yoloxs.py "$ckpt" \
    --out-dir work_dirs/s0_b0_sonar_only_yoloxs_seed0
python tools/collect_results.py work_dirs --out results/results.csv
```

Per-experiment setup, result tables, interpretation and conclusions are kept in `doc/experiments.md` (Chinese); narrative build logs live in `doc/logs/`.

## 6. Paired format (one layout for every source dataset)

```
<root>/camera.json  sonar.json  pairs.csv  frame_meta.csv
<root>/images/camera/...  images/sonar/...
```

`frame_meta.csv` keys each `sample_id` to both COCO image ids, the split and the degradation seed; `read_paired` normalises CSV types. Sync flips are only legal while the sonar bearing axis is 0°-centred (`sonar_zero_centred=True`).

## 7. Degradation protocol

`aodet/datasets/transforms/camera_degradation.py`: physically ordered operator (attenuation → wavelength absorption → scattering veil → blur) with levels D0–D4, D∞ (black / sensor-absent), deterministic per (sample_id, level, seed). Training draws levels from p(s) (F2 §5.2) with D∞ materialised as a black frame (`dinf_mode="zero"`, dense batches); test-time D∞ drops the camera (`dinf_mode="drop"`, batch 1). Offline pinned test sets: `tools/make_degraded_testsets.py` (sha256 manifest per level).

## 8. Evaluation

Per-branch AP by degradation level from saved prediction files (`tools/test.py` → `pred.<branch>.<level>.json` + `ap_summary.json`). Sonar branches are reported against both the full GT and the blob-only subset (`gt=all` / `gt=blob`): projected boxes carry the calibration's range-axis error, so the blob subset is the clean reference. Branch error correlation (φ, conditional miss lift ΔP_miss with bootstrap CI, Spearman confidence correlation, naive-Bayes fused existence ECE) in `aodet/evaluation/branch_correlation.py`, run over a work dir via `tools/correlation_table.py` → `correlation.csv`.

## 9. Status (2026-11-02)

- Environment and pipeline: COCO YOLOX-S reproduction gate passed (AP 40.30 vs official 40.5); the local RTX 5090 runs `.venv-gpu` (torch 2.7.1+cu128, see `env/ENVIRONMENT.md`; torch >= 2.6's weights_only default is handled by the scoped wrapper in `aodet/torch_load_compat`, so resume no longer depends on an env var).
- Data: the UXO sample is converted to `data/paired/uxo/` (2573 pairs; recalibrated after the mirror-basin fix to blob 1319 / projected 1254), training GT blob-only. Full-UXO download in transit: data_processed.7z (57 GiB) passed md5 (11-02 05:32); the two 16 GB export packages follow (`data/raw/uxo-full/download.log`).
- Experiments: E01–E10 in `doc/experiments.md`. E10 is downgraded to a directional reading after the review; of the τ ablation, tau1 has finished and tau4 is resuming from epoch_10 after an incident (see `doc/logs/2026-11-02-tau4-resume-weights-only.md`); both arms are recorded but not interpreted.
- Mainline (restated 2026-11-02, review §0): when the camera degrades, how much does camera information reaching the sonar branch through fusion or distillation help, does the gain come from privilege or capacity, and what does it cost in branch error correlation. First show there is something to transfer (fusion activity, fusion headroom, mutual poisoning), then attribute, then measure correlation.
- Next: E11 (full-UXO class-balanced split + B0/B2/B3 × 3 seeds) is preregistered and all code prerequisites have landed (21f1345 + 6e2043a). On 2026-11-02 the second review added fusion-activity, fusion-headroom, class-transplant upper-bound and mAP@[.5:.95] readings; staged training (B0 ×3 → B2 ×3 → B3 ×3 only when triggered) and interleaved val-ID blocks (`uxo_to_paired --val-id-mode interleaved`) were adopted the same day, before any split was written. Pipeline once data lands: unpack → adapter check on 2 recordings → convert → calibrate (fingerprint cache, restartable) → inventory → frozen split → data gate 0. The train-side resume weights_only fix is closed out (train/test share `aodet/torch_load_compat`, with a save-then-resume smoke test; see the incident log).
- Main risks from the second review (review §9.2): the current cross-attention fusion is inert (E10's fused sonar head reads the same from d0 to D∞); by CMHD's numbers under the same protocol, E11 will most likely land in the ceiling band; E12's cross-modal logit distillation nearly duplicates the label on single-target data, so it needs out-of-fold teachers and a label-smoothing control.
- Open decisions: hard-subset definition (before val is unsealed); paper positioning if E11 lands in the ceiling or floor band, with the ceiling band the most likely and best decided now (review §3.5, §9.2 b); E11 counts within G0, while E12 onward exceeds the draft's G0 authorization and needs sign-off (review §0, §7).
- RSFusionDet repo still empty (checked biweekly, `doc/logs/rsfusiondet-watch.log`).
