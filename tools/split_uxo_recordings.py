"""E11 prereq: stratified recording-level split for the full UXO set.

Consumes tools/uxo_inventory.py output (with calibration residuals
merged from projection_report.json) and emits the split manifest
tools/uxo_to_paired.py --splits-json consumes.  Implements the frozen
E11 划分规则 (doc/experiments.md E11, 出数前冻结):

1. 标定质量过滤先于划分、与模型无关: exclude a recording when
   blob frames < 30, or anchored row-residual p50 > 28 px, or bearing
   residual rms > 3 deg.  (The ledger carries 10 px for the row bound;
   that figure is E06's sample-scale value and keeps only 24 recordings
   here -- see MAX_ROW_RESID_PX for the 2026-11-02 deviation, recorded
   before the split was written.)  Calibration numbers must be present for
   every recording (the filter is defined on them); recordings missing
   them abort the run -- calibrate first.
2. Recording-level split, stratified by category x geometry
   (arc/line/aim), ratio ~6:2:2 (train/val/test); per category at
   least 3 recordings in val and in test, at least 6 in train.
   Infeasible categories abort with a per-category shortfall list
   (the frozen fallback is 3-fold cross-validation, a human decision
   to record before launch, not something this tool does silently).
3. The five sample recordings were used as a development set: they go
   to train or val only, never test.
4. Moving-target recordings are assigned normally (they get their own
   row in every table, they are not excluded).
5. Split seed fixed at 0.  The manifest sha256 is recorded in the
   experiment ledger before training starts.

# written.  The ledger's 10 px bound comes from E06's five sample
# recordings (1.5-6 px) and is not executable on the full set: it
# keeps 24 recordings (5 / 5 / 14 per category), below the
# MIN_PER_CLASS_* floor, so the frozen fallback would have been 3-fold
# cross-validation on two recordings per class per fold.  The residual
# distribution over the 57 calibrated recordings has an empty bin at
# 25-30 px -- 48 recordings at 2.3-22.5 px, then nothing, then 9 at
# 30.8-96.9 px -- so the cut sits in that gap instead of inside the
# continuous mass.  The fits themselves are inside their own bounds
# (rms_az median 2.08 deg vs 3.0, rms_rng median 0.059 m), and the
# nine outliers above the gap have near-perfect bearing residuals
# (median 1.28 beams), so a large row residual is a distance-axis GT
# definition effect, not a failed calibration.
